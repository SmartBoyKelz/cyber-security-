A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO SOLVING CYBERSECURITY PROBLEM

This project simulated a Network Intrusion Detector on a small scale consists of
- A Network capture script (Tshark working in the terminal background)
- A network detection Python script (using Machine learning Classification)
- An attacking Machine. Kali Linux, containing preloaded attacks for testing purposes. 


The Model was trained to recognise malicious network actions using NSL-KDD data a collection of over 200,000 records
that contains network data(packet details) using the Random Forest Classifier Algorithm.

In creating the Network capture Script, I was a bit of a Script Kiddy to get the basic Concept after which I follow up to create the network capture
as well as establish the SSH connection to transmit the data (in .csv) format between the Virtual Machines.
